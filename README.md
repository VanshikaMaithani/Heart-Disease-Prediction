# Heart-Disease-Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health-related features. It employs machine learning algorithms to analyze a dataset containing information about individuals' health and applies predictive models to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/code/desalegngeb/heart-disease-predictions/input]. It includes features such as age, gender, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. A detailed description of the dataset can be found in the `info` list within the code.

## Project Structure

- `heart-disease-prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
- `heart.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models.
- `app/`: (Optional) Contains files for deploying a web application if applicable.
